This is my final Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project!

For this one, I was to make a replica of an Etch-a-Sketch using Javascript using DOM Manipulation. Although, I did use HTML and CSS, this app is mostly made through Javascript and styled in CSS. Although I will keep making updates to this project, I think that it actually works pretty seamlessly and I'm pretty proud of it. 

These are the things that I learned:

-DOM Manipulation, specifically using Event Handlers and Event Listeners, this one was tough to fully understand but this project helped me grasp the concepts that we learned. 

-Creating functions: Although I am starting to really understand Functions now, this project was great to further my understanding of them. I am beginning to feel much more comfortable with arrow-functions and I will keep using them more & more!

Overall, this project was awesome and was very difficult for me, yet very very rewarding. I do think that I need to keep working on getting better at CSS, but I'm getting there!
